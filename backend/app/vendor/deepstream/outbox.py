"""Durable attendance outbox — a local, crash-safe buffer so no recognition is
lost when PostgreSQL is briefly unavailable.

Design (the "transactional outbox" / local-WAL pattern):
  * PostgreSQL stays the source of truth. The outbox only holds events that
    could NOT be written yet (DB down/unreachable).
  * On a DB outage, ``add()`` fsync-persists the raw event to a SQLite file on
    the pipeline's persistent volume. When the DB recovers, ``flush()`` replays
    them in order and deletes each once it lands in Postgres.
  * One file per company (``COMPANY_ID``) so concurrent company pipelines don't
    contend on a shared file.

This gives effectively-100% retention for attendance-scale traffic (bounded only
by local-disk survival) without a message broker.
